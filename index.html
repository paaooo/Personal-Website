            <p>My name is John Paul Louie Meek. I am currently studying computer science at RTC.</p>
            <p>Growing up, I liked math and video games because in them, you could accomplish tasks using different methods, and eventually be able to have your own style/method. I had reached the top 0.1% in the game DOTA 2 using my own unorthodox way of brawling with a certain farming hero. Other than that, you could also observe how other players play and adapt some of their knowledge and habits into your own. When I discovered programming, I felt the same spark I had with math and games. You could finish projects using your own creative ways, and you could even make up projects that you desire to make. You could have your own style, and you could also observe what other people do and adapt what they do into your own which got me hooked into programming.</p>

            <legend><h2>My Computer Science Journey</h2></legend>
            <p>In 2017, I had taken an AP Computer Science course, which was my first, as a sophomore in my highschool which started me off with Java, and has started off my interest in programming. In that class, we had created lots of projects, notably a fraction calculator, and a Zork-type game.</p>
            <p>A year later in 2018, I had taken more computer programming classes where I learned Python. That year, I also took a cybersecurity course, got to dabble a bit to making some short music/sounds using programming, and got to make some games in my computer programming course, notably a flappy bird game, a pong game, and a survival-type doodle jump game.</p>
            <p>My last year in high school includes a robotics course that I took where I got to work with arduinos and 3d-printers. A lot of projects were made in that class but the notable ones are a music box, a self-driving toy car, and a solar tracker.</p>
            <p>For post-secondary, I took on RTC's computer science course, which I'm currently taking. I've encountered and learned more programming languages in the course such as c#, java, html, and sql, and learned more topics such as Computer Networking, Databases, Time Complexity, etc.</p>
